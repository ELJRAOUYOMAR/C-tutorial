# Linked list

## definition:
A linked list is a data structure consisting of a sequence of elements where each element points to the next element in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size and can grow or shrink dynamically.
In C, we typically implement a linked list using structures. Each element of the linked list is represented by a structure called a node. Each node contains two parts:
- Data: The actual data being stored.
- Pointer: A reference to the next node in the sequence.
